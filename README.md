Hi! My name is Marc, I'm a PhD student with the group of Prof. Hasenauer at the university of Bonn.

My work focuses on the application of machine learning methods to biomedical data, including sequencing, imaging, FACS etc. On the methodical side, I am most interested in feature extraction and interpretability.
